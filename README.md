## Introduction: 

According to Built In, only
 26% of tech-related jobs are held by women.
 3% of those jobs held by African-American women, 6% held by Asian women, and 2% held by Hispanic women.
 48% of women in STEM jobs face discrimination in the hiring process.
 50% of women said they have experienced gender discrimination at work
 22% women are more likely to experience Imposter Syndrome in the workplace

These are just a few of many statistics that describe the gender and racial disparity in employment within the tech industry.

## Inspiration

"I raise up my voice—not so that I can shout, but so that those without a voice can be heard. … We cannot all succeed when half of us are held back."
\- By Malala Yousafzai

Our aim is to have a one stop solution, a single place for everything from opportunities to a safe place to discuss everything, recent updates, a place to show their works and so much more! Through our project we also aim to build genuine professional mentor-mentee relationships amongst women over the world.

## Our Goal
A one stop place for everything, from open discussions, mentorships, forums, gallery, latest updates, to opportunities and so much more!

### Key Features

- Forum : It's a place to discuss anything and everything openly. Anyone can create an open thread with any topic they wish to discuss and continue the discussion under it! 
- Blogs : It's a space where we've some handpicked blogs linked for our users sharing the latest happenings in the world!
- Gallery : It's a place for the users to share any works that they work upon. Sharing and encouraging each other, encouraging a highly supportive community!
- Opportunity: It's a place where users can post various events and opportunities with respective hashtags. It can be used for exclusive openings and opportunities for women, upcoming events and much more. After a user clicks on a hashtag, they'll be redirected to a page having events only under that hashtag, furthermore they can subscribe to this to get notifications! The events can interactively be also seen on Azure maps.
- Mentorship section :  This section includes various features like chat and video call, feed, search page, mentor and mentee profiles, ability to save and share posts and mentor profiles.
- User Profile: Users can create their profiles, adding more about their skills, experience, sessions they have taken and more. The same can be updated as well.
- Scheduling calls : Users would be able to schedule the calls with their mentors, and get push notification reminders for them as well. This would be included in the mentorship section.
- Donation : Women oriented NGOs can register and donate to our cause via QR codes. The feature would be a part of our application.

### How we plan to widen audience range and become a people centric application: 
1. Bot support : Bot support would be available at every instant of time, to just chat, receive advice or accomplish some simple tasks of the application.
2. Oue application would be colour blind friendly.
3. Special tags in opportunities for LGBTQ women would be found on our application, promoting further diversity.
